	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>
		Hi there! I'm Michelle and I'm excited about Programming Languages and Compilers research. I'm currently working on Static Analysis and WASM with Professors Frank Tip and Amal Ahmed. In the past, I have worked on Compiler Generation and Data Flow Analysis with Professor Uday Khedker at IIT Bombay. I have been active in STEM and Research Outreach during my undergrad and am invested in making research more accessible for underrepresented students and students from disconnected undergrad programs. If you want to talk about PL, outreach or research in general, feel free to reach out to me!

	<h2>Research</h2>

	<p>I am currently working on WebAssembly and Static Analysis for WebAssembly. For my undergrad project, I worked on formalizing the translations of a compiler at IITB called <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/sclp-web/">SCLP</a> and generating code from these specs. We did some super cool things during this project and we're currently writing a paper about our work. In the summer of 2020, I worked on the problem of efficiently storing and operating on an incrementally discovered sparse family of sets, in order to make different analyses in Data Flow Analysis more scalable. During the project I designed a lattice-based data structure that I had a lot of fun thinking about. The summer before that I visited IIT Patna and worked on problems in Dimensionality Reduction with Professor Jimson Mathew's lab. We were interested in finding ways to translate Machine Learning research to real-world applications by extracting meaningful information from surplus data and finding ways to adapt Dimensionality Reduction algorithms to semi-supervised settings.</p>
