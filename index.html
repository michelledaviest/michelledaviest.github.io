	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>
		Hi there! I'm Michelle and I'm excited about Programming Languages and Compiler research. I'm currently working on Compiler Generation and Data Flow Analysis with Professor Uday Khedker at IIT Bombay. I have been active in STEM and Research Outreach during my undergrad and am invested in making research more accessible for underrepresented students and students from disconnected undergrad programs. If you want to talk about PL, outreach or research in general, feel free to reach out to me!

	<h2>Research</h2>

	<p>I am currently working with Professor Uday Khedker at IIT Bombay for my B.Tech. Project on generating phases of a compiler automatically through their translation specifications. Our project groups work focuses on the <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/sclp-web/">SCLP compiler</a> at IITB. In the summer of 2020, I worked on the problem of efficiently storing and operating on an incrementally discovered sparse family of sets, in order to make different analyses in Data Flow Analysis more scalable. During the project I  designed a lattice-based data structure that I'm pretty proud of and had a lot of fun thinking about. This project is still ongoing. The summer before that I visited IIT Patna and worked on problems in Dimensionality Reduction with Professor Jimson Mathew's lab. We were interested in finding ways to translate Machine Learning research to real-world applications by extracting meaningful information from surplus data and finding ways to adapt Dimensionality Reduction algorithms to semi-supervised settings. My work there encompassed Relative Distance Constraints and Label propagation and I co-authored three publications in the six months that I worked with their group.</p>
