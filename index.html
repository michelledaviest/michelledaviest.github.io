	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am interested in Programming Languages and Compiler research and am currently exploring Data Flow Analysis problems with Professor Uday Khedker at IIT Bombay. I have also been active in STEM and Research Outreach during my undergrad and am invested in making research more accessible for students from disconnected undergrad programs. If you want to talk about PL, outreach or research in general, feel free to reach out to me! </p>

	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p>I am interested in building theoretical abstractions and frameworks to advance problems seen in applied research topics in Programming Languages and Compilers. I interested in research that has its foundations in theory, is efficient, scalable and can be applied to real-life tools and applications. </p>
	<p>I have done some work in Data Flow Analysis on the problem of efficiently storing and operating on incrementally discovered sparse family of sets, in order to make Data Flow Analysis more scalable. I have previously worked with Professor Jimson Mathew at IIT Patna on problems in Dimensionality Reduction. We were interested in finding ways to translate Machine Learning research to real-world applications by extracting meaningful information
from surplus data and finding ways to adapt Dimensionality Reduction algorithms to semi-supervised
settings. </p>
