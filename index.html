			<p>Hi there! My name is Michelle Davies Thalakottur. I am interested in Programming Langauges and Compiler research and am currently exploring Data Flow Analysis problems with Professor Uday Khedker at IIT Bombay. I have also been active in STEM and Research Outreach during my undergrad and am invested in making research more accessible for students from disconnected undergrad programs. If you want to talk about PL, outreach or research in general, feel free to reach out to me! </p>
